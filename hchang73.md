# Git merge vs GitHub Pull Request
Git merge is a local Git command that combines changes from one local branch to another on your computer. A GitHub Pull Request is a web-based feature on GitHub; it is a request to the repository owner to review and merge your remote changes into their repository, and it includes code review and discussion features before merging.
